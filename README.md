# 2022-2023-ACSL-Senior-Contest-4-Solution
My solution to the 2022-2023 ACSL Senior Division Contest 4.

The problem asks us to complete the "missingArrow" function below with the following information:

Given an integer N that represents the dimensions of a matrix, a string "targets" that represents the locations of the targets, a string "numbers" that represents how many arrows are on each row and each column, and a string "arrows" that represent the locations and directions of all the arrows except one, write a program that finds the location and direction of the missing arrows.

Constraints:
- Exactly one arrow faces each target
- If the number of arrows in each row and column passes the numbers given in the string "numbers," it doesn't work
